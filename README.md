# SymbolSight - CNN Image Classification Model

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. The model is designed to classify images of mathematical symbols, whether they are sourced from a local directory, from the web, or hand-drawn in a paint application.

## Overview

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have revolutionized image classification tasks by automatically learning features from input images. This project leverages the power of CNNs to accurately classify mathematical symbols with an impressive accuracy rate of 98%.

## Features

- **Image Classification:** Utilizes a CNN to classify images of mathematical symbols.
- **Source Flexibility:** Supports classification of symbols from local directories, web images, and hand-drawn symbols.
- **High Accuracy:** Achieves a classification accuracy of 98%.
   
## Usage

1. **Dataset Preparation:** Organize your dataset of mathematical symbols. Ensure a diverse range of symbols are included for training.

2. **Model Training:** Train the CNN model using the provided dataset. Fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize performance.
